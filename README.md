A one-shot counsel bot powered by GPT-3 that answers mental health questions using knowledge about CBT diagnosis and treatment.

Code companion to the paper A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Chatbot Powered by GPT-3 (see pdf attachment) authored by Filippos Nakas, Harper Caroll, and Leyla Kursat for Stanford's CS224U Final Project. The code included here is only for running the final bot so please read/skim the paper before using it to understand its design and how it was tested.
 
Run Ask_CBT_Bot.py in terminal inserting your OPEN AI API key after the --key arguement and your mental health question after the --question arguement. Make sure that all the embedding files are in the same folder before running. 
****Please note that the bot is purely experimental and its answers should not be taken as a reliable CBT diagnosis. Read the paper to learn about its limitations.****
